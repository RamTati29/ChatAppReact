# ChatApp using chatEngine and React

# Project Explanation:
Chat Application using React and ChatEngine

This project is a real-time chat application built using React and ChatEngine. ChatEngine is a powerful chat API and SDK that simplifies the process of building chat applications. With this application, users can engage in real-time conversations, create chat rooms, and exchange messages seamlessly.

# Integration Steps:
  Follow these steps to integrate your React application with ChatEngine:

  ChatEngine Account:
    Sign up for a ChatEngine account at ChatEngine.
    Create a new project to obtain the Project ID, which is essential for integrating ChatEngine into your React application.

  Clone the Repository:
      
      git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-react-chat-app.git](https://github.com/RamTati29/ChatAppReact.git)
      cd your-react-chat-app
  
  Install Dependencies:
    
      npm install
      Configure ChatEngine:
    
  Open your React application code.
    Locate the ChatEngine configuration section (usually found in a file like Chat.js or App.js).
    Replace the placeholder values with your ChatEngine Project ID.
    
    change projectID in App.js and LoginForm.js 
    enter your project id which you will get after creating project in chatEngine
  
  Run the Application:
    
    npm start

  Your React chat application should now be running locally.
  Test the Chat:
  Note that the current version of the project only implements login functionality.
  To use the chat application, you need to create a user from the ChatEngine site.
  Open the application in your web browser and test the chat functionality. Create new chat rooms, send messages, and ensure real-time updates are working.
